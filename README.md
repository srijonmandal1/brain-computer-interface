# Brain-Computer-Interface
Reconstruction of Dream using Morse Code-based Prediction Algorithm and Generative AI.

This project provides the steps for translating simulated brainwave signals into Morse code and decoding them into text and images.

The Notebooks contains the code blocks for the following steps

- Mapping functions for converting Morse Code to EEG Signals.
- Generator functions for creating Synthetic Dataset
- Training the simulated signals (labelled by corresponding morse codes)
- Prediction using the model
- Visualization of prediction output
